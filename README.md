# minecraft-status
Node.js module for gathering information about Minecraft Java Edition versions 1.7+, 1.6, 1.4-1.5 servers and Minecraft Bedrock Edition servers.

**minecraft-status** was based off of [mc-ping-updated](https://github.com/Cryptkeeper/mc-ping-updated), [mc-stat](https://github.com/winny-/mcstat), and [mcpe-ping](https://github.com/falkirks/mcpe-ping).

**minecraft-status** supports the [Server List Ping](https://wiki.vg/Server_List_Ping) protocol for Minecraft Java Edition servers on Minecraft version 1.7 and above, [1.6](https://wiki.vg/Server_List_Ping#1.6), and [1.4 through 1.5](https://wiki.vg/Server_List_Ping#1.4_to_1.5). **minecraft-status** also supports both the UDP full and basic query protocols.
